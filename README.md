# MkvM
A simple mkvmerge wrapper to clean the track titles of video files, in bulk!


This project is only possible thanks to the following open-source libraries and tools ðŸ’™:

- **mkvmerge**: Part of the [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) suite, used for creating and modifying MKV files.
- **mkvtoolnix**: A set of tools to work with Matroska files (MKV format).

#### This software is in beta. Use it at your own risk!

## Use Case
Videos are composed of tracks. A track could be of type video, audio, subtitle, chapters or attachement. Sometimes, video files are generated with random track names, either due to the recording device, source (DVD, BluRay), transcoding or ripping software, or people that reprocessed the file adding their own track names, like these ones:

![Dirty Track Name 2](https://i.ibb.co/Wsbbyzj/Screenshot-From-2025-01-18-20-50-43.png)

![Dirty Track Name 1](https://i.ibb.co/pnpg7jQ/Screenshot-From-2025-01-18-20-55-13.png)

This software processes all video files and removes specific "values" from the track name:

Although you can do this with MKVToolNix, I did not found an option to do it in bulk. That's why this app exists.

## How to use it?

You can run this app locally by downloading the source code and compiling it, or in a Docker environment using the Docker image (recommended). A much more user-friendly documentation will be provided in the future, as well as binaries for those that do not want to build from the source code.

### Docker Image (recommended)
This app has a docker image in [Docker Hub - j4ssgg/mkvm](https://hub.docker.com/r/j4ssgg/mkvm).
I encourage you to use Docker Compose. The following example file should fit most of the cases. 

```
# Make sure to read and understand this settings before executing the app.
# This software is in beta. Use at your own risk!
# Remove all comments
# Default values are set as I use it when testing, no special meaning on them.

  backend:
    image: 'j4ssgg/mkvm:beta' # This software is in beta. Use at your own risk!

    # Create as many volumes as you need; better if under /app to avoid conflicts. 
    # This is required so the app can read the files. You will use this later in environment variables (see below)
    volumes:
      - /your/path/to/movies:/app/media               # This is the path to the folder where the app will look for the files to process
      - /your/path/to/documents:/app/config           # This is the path to the database file, to the track_names.txt file, and to the replacements file. The app will create the database if it does not exist.
    environment:
      - WorkingDirectory=/app/media                   # This is the default value to read into /media; notice volume matches here ... you can change it to /media/subfolder if the volume contains subfolders: /your/path/to/movies/subfolder
      - DatabaseFile=/app/config/mkvm.sqlite          # Update this if you want to use a different name for the database file  (remember to update the volume too in the volumes section)
      - ReplacementsFile=/app/config/replacements.txt # Update this if you want to use a different name for the replacements file (remember to update the volume too in the volumes section)
      - ReplaceOriginal=False                         # If you want to replace the original file with the new one or generate a new file with a different name
      - OverwriteExisting=False                       # If you want to overwrite the new file if it already exists - not sure if this will ever be useful, but it's there
      - IncludeAllExtensions=False                    # Make sure to not include all extensions if under WorkingDirectory there are files that are not videos, this will make the app to crash (I am too lazy to fix it at this point)
      - Extensions=.mkv,.mp4,.avi                     # Not regex supported, just comma separated extensions with dot, case-insensitive
      - IncludeSubFolders=True                        # If you want to include subfolders in the search or only process file in the WorkingDirectory
      - UpdateListOfFilesProcessed=True               # Whether to save in the DB the list of files processed or not. 
      - IgnoreListOfFilesProcessed=False              # Be careful with this, it will ignore the list of files processed and will process all files in the WorkingDirectory, generating a lot of files if ReplaceOriginal is False and/or IncludeSubFolders is True
      - TimeInMinutesBetweenExecutions=60             # This is the time in minutes between executions of the app
      - ExtractTrackNamesOnly=False                   # Only extract track names of all files. This is useful to generate the replacements file. File is saved in /app/config/track_names.txt (if exists, it will be overwritten)
```
